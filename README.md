# Demo Layout

This demo shows some common basic layout used in android

At the start I was planning to write a small demo that can switch between layout in a single app

But for some reason, I cannot use Intent and startActivity() to switch screen. Which lead to finding a roundabout way using comment

Just remove the comment for setContentView(layout_name_here) and run to see that layout. before that remember to comment all the unecessary part such as other setContentView() function

Except for GridView and ListView, the rest are only a sinlge setContentView() change
